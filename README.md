## building
* [Download LATEST in releases](https://github.com/nelvismyname/fuel.ngl/releases/)
* or build from scratch by downloading the zip file

## why is the source code here not like what is in the release?
i dont wanna waste fuel.ngl's potential but i still am opening doors to people that may want to create their own version.
